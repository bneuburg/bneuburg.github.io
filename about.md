I am interested in Open Source with a focus on Debian Linux and in topics related to IT Security.

Moreover I am a big proponent of configuration management and KVM based virtualization.

In this blog I am going to cover things related to work and IT related stuff I do in my spare time.

[Cyber][cybercyber] all the things.
